# cirrusImage is a work in progress. #

More importantly [cirrusImage](http://cirrusimage.net) is a location for me to store an image with information about that image as a single file. This allows [cirrusImage](http://cirrusimage.net) to have an [API](http://api.cirrusimage.net) for retrieving that information and/or image. Beyond being a showcase of my Works In Progress Current Work is a showcase highlighting a few of my development interests. Namely flat-file storage of descriptive text within the image. a.k.a image metadata and, in this specific case, [EXIF](http://www.exif.org/) Comments. Additionally the pages are "Content Rich" or "[SEO](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35291) Friendly" meaning that all the html or xhtml metadata is filled from descriptive data from the image files. Therefore, this project hands-off images data in the form of a url request with XHTML, JSON and PHP5 :D
